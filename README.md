# CoolMath
An Android WebView wrapper for the website: http://coolmath-games.com

My kids really like the iPad app and website Cool Math Games. I have a couple of cheapo android tablets sitting around and they were interested in playing those games on those devices. Given the limited screen real estate of the 7 inch tablets, I thought it would be nice to have the browser chrome removed from the mobile website. Thus I created this. Use it if you want. Modifiy it if you want. Do whatever you want. I'm just leaving it here in case anyone else is interested in a similar solution.

If you'd like the build of the APK that I am using on my kids' tablets without building it yourself, I have it available at http://aug.tech/games/coolmath.apk
